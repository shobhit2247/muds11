Keynote on Removal of Directors Disqualification

Someone can regain their position as a Director after being disqualified via one of the two procedures or a set of methods. As a result, it is critical to consult with an expert CA, CS, or lawyer as soon as possible following Directors Disqualification to address the situation.

Object to the Decision to Disqualify

A disqualified director may appeal the judgement with 30 days' notice to temporarily halt the ruling. According to the Companies Act of 2013, an order disqualifying a director does not take effect within 30 days of the conviction, sentence, or order. Once an appeal is filed, the individual retains the position of Director for a period of seven days after the appeal or petition is dismissed. As a result, anyone who has received an order may file returns and enter a plea within 1 month to halt the direction of director disqualification.

Interim appoint new directors

Following disqualification, the first step for promoters is to file late returns. However, once a company's disqualified directors, the disqualified directors are banned from filing any delayed MCA annual returns in order to bring compliance up to date. As a result, the current Directors must carry out resolutions to nominate a new Director to the Board of Directors of the Company. 

To avoid this, the Directors, along with a Professional, would have to approach the relevant Registrar of Corporations for the appointment of disqualified directors via the MCA backend office.
